# RRL-testopticalflow

This repository contains two scripts for running algorithms related to optical flow on ultrasound data.

`densetest.py` is adapted from Chuan-En Lin at https://github.com/chuanenlin/optical-flow.
`contours.py` runs many OpenCV implementations of different optical flow algorithms for testing.
